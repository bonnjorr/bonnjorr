- 👋 Hi, I’m @bonnjorr
- 👀 I’m interested in too much: Data Analytics, Automating repetitive tasks for myself and others, 
-   cleanly housing data, and improving processes. 
-     I'm accomplishing this using excel, vba, power bi, access, and SQL 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for Data Analytics, Statistics, VBA, HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that results in "click this button for magic!"
- 📫 How to reach me ...
